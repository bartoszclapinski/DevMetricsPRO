## 🎯 What the AI Should Do After Reading

After the AI reads those files, it should:

### 1. **Understand Current State**
- ✅ Know we're in **Sprint 2** (GitHub Integration & Background Jobs)
- ✅ Know **Phases 2.1-2.6** are complete (OAuth, repos, commits, Hangfire, PRs all working!)
- ✅ Know **UI Redesign** is complete (all 4 parts done!)
- ✅ Know the **next phase** is **Phase 2.7** (Basic Metrics Calculation)
- ✅ Understand **Sprint 1** is fully complete (Authentication working)

### 2. **Understand the Workflow**
- ✅ **AI provides guidance** on what to implement and how
- ✅ **User implements code** in their IDE based on AI guidance
- ✅ **AI reviews user's implementation** and provides feedback
- ✅ **Issue-driven development**: Create GitHub issue → branch → implement → PR → merge
- ✅ **Learning mode**: Explain concepts, teach as we go
- ✅ **Documentation**: Keep sprint log updated with learnings

### 3. **Know the Tech Stack**
- .NET 9 with C# 12
- Blazor Server (SignalR for real-time)
- ASP.NET Core Identity + JWT
- PostgreSQL 16 + TimescaleDB
- Redis 7
- Entity Framework Core 9
- MudBlazor for UI
- Hangfire for background jobs

### 4. **Follow the Architecture**
```
Core ← Application ← Infrastructure
                   ← Web
```
- Dependencies ONLY point inward
- Use async/await everywhere with CancellationToken
- Use DTOs for data transfer (never expose entities)
- Keep business logic in Application layer

### 5. **Key Conventions**
- ✅ File-scoped namespaces
- ✅ Nullable reference types enabled
- ✅ Async methods end with `Async`
- ✅ Constructor injection for DI
- ✅ PascalCase for classes/methods, _camelCase for private fields
- ✅ Use `required` keyword for required properties
- ✅ Use modern C# 12 features (collection expressions, etc.)

## 🚀 What to Do Next (Phase 2.7 - Basic Metrics Calculation)

Based on `sprint-log.md`, the next phase is **Phase 2.7: Basic Metrics Calculation**:

1. **Create Metrics Service**
   - IMetricsCalculationService interface
   - Calculate basic metrics per developer:
     - Total commits
     - Lines added/removed
     - Pull requests (opened, merged)
     - Active days
     - Average commit size

2. **Store Metrics in Database**
   - Use existing Metric entity
   - Store MetricType and Value
   - Link to Developer and date range
   - Support historical data

3. **Calculate Metrics in Background Job**
   - Add metrics calculation to SyncGitHubDataJob
   - Run after data sync completes
   - Update existing metrics or create new

4. **Test Metrics Calculation**
   - Verify metrics stored correctly
   - Check calculations are accurate
   - View metrics in database

## ⚠️ Important Notes for AI

### Do's ✅
- ✅ **Read sprint log first** - Shows daily progress and learnings
- ✅ **Create GitHub issue** before each phase
- ✅ **Create feature branch** from master (never commit to master)
- ✅ **Provide detailed guidance** - User is learning Blazor/.NET
- ✅ **Review user implementations** thoroughly
- ✅ **Update sprint log** after completing work
- ✅ **Use read tools** - Read files, search codebase, understand context

### Don'ts ❌
- ❌ **Don't skip reading documentation** - Critical context!
- ❌ **Don't commit to master** - Always use feature branch
- ❌ **Don't guess** - If unsure, ask user or search codebase
- ❌ **Don't implement code directly** - User implements with your guidance
- ❌ **Don't forget to update sprint log** - Continuity is key
- ❌ **Don't skip testing** - Verify changes work

---

## 🎓 Learning Mode

The user is **learning Blazor and .NET**, so:

1. **Explain concepts** - What is this? Why are we doing it?
2. **Reference documentation** - Point to `.cursor/*.mdc` files for details
3. **Discuss trade-offs** - Why this approach over alternatives?
4. **Encourage questions** - Make sure user understands before moving on
5. **Document learnings** - Add to sprint log for future reference

---

## 🔍 Quick Health Check

Before starting work, verify:

1. ✅ **Docker running**: `docker ps` shows PostgreSQL + Redis
2. ✅ **Database updated**: Migrations applied
3. ✅ **Solution builds**: `dotnet build` succeeds
4. ✅ **Dev server works**: Can access `https://localhost:5234`
5. ✅ **Auth works**: Can register and login

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start with sprint log** - Shows what works, what doesn't, and why
2. **Use helper scripts** - Test endpoints quickly with PowerShell scripts
3. **Check .cursor rules** - Quick reference for conventions
4. **Update as you go** - Keep sprint log current for next AI session
5. **Explain, don't just code** - User is learning, so teach concepts
6. **Test thoroughly** - Verify changes work before moving on

---

## 📞 If You Get Stuck

1. **Search codebase** - Use `codebase_search` or `grep` tools
2. **Read implementation** - Check existing code for patterns
3. **Check sprint log** - See how similar problems were solved
4. **Ask user** - They know the project history and context
5. **Reference docs** - `.cursor/*.mdc` files have detailed guidance

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know you're on the right track when:

- ✅ You understand what sprint/phase we're on
- ✅ You know what's been completed and what's next
- ✅ You follow the workflow (issue → branch → implement → PR)
- ✅ You explain concepts as you implement
- ✅ You update sprint log with progress and learnings
- ✅ You ask for approval before pushing changes
- ✅ You maintain architectural principles (Clean Architecture, async/await, DTOs)

---

## 🚀 Ready to Start!

Once you've read the required files and understand the project status, you should:

1. **Confirm understanding**: "I've read the sprint log. We're in Sprint 2, Phases 2.1-2.6 complete (OAuth, repos, commits, Hangfire, PRs all working!). Next is Phase 2.7 (Basic Metrics Calculation)."
2. **Summarize status**: "GitHub integration fully working. Background jobs sync repos, commits, and PRs automatically. Professional UI redesign complete. Dashboard shows real GitHub data."
3. **Ask for direction**: "Would you like to continue with Phase 2.7 (Metrics), or work on something else?"

Let's build something great! 🎉
