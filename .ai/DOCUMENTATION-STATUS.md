## 📝 Key Workflow Principles Documented

### 1. Issue-Driven Development
Every feature/phase MUST have a GitHub issue created first.

**Example**:
- Issue #38: Sprint 1 Phase 1.9: Basic Blazor UI with Authentication

### 2. AI Implements, User Reviews (UPDATED!)
- **AI** implements code directly using available tools
- **AI** explains what is being implemented and why
- **USER** reviews changes in IDE and approves
- **AI** commits changes after user approval
- **Both** learn together through the process

### 3. Feature Branches
All work happens on feature branches with naming convention:
```
sprintX/phaseY.Z-feature-name-#IssueNumber
```

**Example**:
```
sprint1/phase1.4-logging-error-handling-#26
```

### 4. Conventional Commits
Standardized commit messages:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Closes #IssueNumber
```

**Example**:
```
feat(logging): add Serilog configuration for structured logging

Closes #26
```

### 5. Pull Requests
All changes merged via PRs with:
- Link to issue
- Clear description (auto-filled from commits)
- Simple checklist (builds, CI, tested)
