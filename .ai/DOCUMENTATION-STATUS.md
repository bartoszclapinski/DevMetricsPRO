## 🆕 New Documentation Added

### `WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md` (NEW!)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide to our development workflow for future AI assistants and new developers.

**Contents**:
- ✅ Issue-driven development process
- ✅ User-implements, AI-guides approach
- ✅ Step-by-step workflow for each phase
- ✅ Git branching conventions (`sprintX/phaseY.Z-feature-#IssueNumber`)
- ✅ Conventional commit message format
- ✅ PR creation and merge procedures
- ✅ Daily development cycle
- ✅ Sprint log documentation standards
- ✅ Learning approach and question patterns
- ✅ Important rules for AI and User
- ✅ Progress tracking methods
- ✅ Common commands reference (EF Core, Git, Testing, Build)
- ✅ Phase completion checklist
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides

**Why It's Important**:
This document ensures ANY AI assistant can pick up where we left off and continue with the same workflow, maintaining consistency and quality.

## 📝 Key Workflow Principles Documented

### 1. Issue-Driven Development
Every feature/phase MUST have a GitHub issue created first.

**Example**:
- Issue #26: Sprint 1 Phase 1.4: Logging & Error Handling

### 2. User Implements, AI Guides
- **AI** provides instructions on what to implement and where
- **USER** writes the actual code
- **AI** reviews and provides feedback

### 3. Feature Branches
All work happens on feature branches with naming convention:
```
sprintX/phaseY.Z-feature-name-#IssueNumber
```

**Example**:
```
sprint1/phase1.4-logging-error-handling-#26
```

### 4. Conventional Commits
Standardized commit messages:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Closes #IssueNumber
```

**Example**:
```
feat(logging): add Serilog configuration for structured logging

Closes #26
```

### 5. Pull Requests
All changes merged via PRs with:
- Link to issue
- Clear description (auto-filled from commits)
- Simple checklist (builds, CI, tested)
