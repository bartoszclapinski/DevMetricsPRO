# DevMetrics Pro - Development Workflow Guide 🔄

This document describes the **issue-driven, guided-implementation** workflow used in this project. This workflow is designed for learning while building production-quality code.

---

## 🎯 Core Workflow Principles

### 1. **Issue-Driven Development**
Every feature, phase, or significant change MUST have a GitHub issue created first.

### 2. **AI Implements, User Reviews**
- The **AI implements code directly** using available tools
- The **AI explains** what is being implemented and why
- The **USER reviews and approves** changes before they're applied
- The **USER learns** by understanding the implementation
- The **AI** commits changes after user approval

### 3. **Learning-First Approach**
- Explanations are provided for **WHY** we do things
- Concepts are explained **as we implement** them
- Questions are encouraged and answered immediately
- Documentation captures learnings

### 4. **Small, Incremental Steps**
- Each phase is broken into small steps
- Each step is testable independently
- Frequent commits with clear messages
- Regular verification and review

---

## 📋 Standard Workflow for Each Phase

### Step 1: Create GitHub Issue
**ALWAYS start with an issue!**

```markdown
Title: Sprint X Phase Y.Z: [Phase Name]

Description:
- Brief description of what this phase accomplishes
- Key tasks to complete
- Acceptance criteria
- References to sprint plan
```

**Example:**
- Issue #26: Sprint 1 Phase 1.4: Logging & Error Handling

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch
**ALWAYS work on a feature branch!**

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b sprint1/phase1.X-feature-name-#IssueNumber
```

**Naming convention:**
- `sprintX/phaseY.Z-feature-name-#IssueNumber`
- Example: `sprint1/phase1.4-logging-error-handling-#26`

### Step 3: AI Implements Feature
**AI implements the code directly:**

```
Now let's implement [Feature].

I'll create [File] at [path]:

[Explanation of what this file does and why]

Here's what I'm implementing:
[Code explanation with key concepts]

[AI uses tools to create/modify files]
```

### Step 4: User Reviews Implementation
**USER reviews and approves changes:**

```
[User sees the changes in their IDE]

User: Ok, looks good / I have a question about [X]
```

### Step 5: AI Commits Changes (with User Approval)
**AI commits after user confirms:**

```
Perfect! Let me commit these changes...

[AI uses git add and git commit]

Committed! Ready for the next step?
```

### Step 6: Push Changes
**AI or User pushes the feature branch:**

```bash
git push origin sprint1/phase1.4-logging-error-handling-#26
```

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer with issue reference]

Closes #IssueNumber
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Step 7: Create Pull Request
**Title format:**
```
sprintX/phaseY.Z: [Description] - Closes #IssueNumber
```

**Example:**
```
sprint1/phase1.4: Add Serilog and global exception handler - Closes #26
```

**PR Description:**
- Auto-filled from commits (due to conventional commits)
- Just check the checkboxes:
  - [ ] Builds successfully
  - [ ] CI checks passing
  - [ ] Tested locally

### Step 8: Merge and Continue
**After PR approval:**

```bash
# Merge via GitHub UI
# Then pull latest master
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Ready for next phase!
```

## 🔄 Daily Development Cycle

### Morning (5 minutes)
1. Open sprint log file (`.ai/sprints/sprintX/sprint-log.md`)
2. Review yesterday's progress
3. Check GitHub issues for current phase
4. Plan today's focus

### During Development (2-3 hours)
1. **AI implements**: "Let's implement [Feature]..." [uses tools]
2. **User reviews**: "Ok, looks good..." [reviews in IDE]
3. **AI explains**: "Here's what this does and why..."
4. **Repeat** for each step in the phase
5. **AI commits** after each working step (with user approval)

### End of Phase
1. **Run tests**: Verify everything works
2. **Update sprint log**: Document learnings
3. **Commit and push**: Push feature branch
4. **Create PR**: Link to issue
5. **Merge**: After CI checks pass

### Evening (5 minutes)
1. Update sprint log with progress
2. Note time spent
3. Document any challenges
4. Plan tomorrow's focus

---

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### Sprint Log Updates
**After each phase, add to sprint log:**

```markdown
### Day X - YYYY-MM-DD
**Phases completed**:
- [x] Phase X.Y: [Name] ✅

**What I learned**:
- [Concept 1]: [Explanation]
- [Concept 2]: [Explanation]
- [Technical detail]: [Why it's important]

**Time spent**: X hours
**Blockers**: None / [describe]
**Notes**: [Additional observations]
```

### Commit Messages
**ALWAYS use conventional commits:**

```bash
feat(auth): add JWT token generation service
fix(db): resolve migration conflict in Developers table
docs(readme): update setup instructions
test(repository): add integration tests for UnitOfWork
refactor(logging): extract Serilog config to separate class
chore(deps): update EF Core to version 9.0.0
```

### Pull Request Templates
**We use a simple checkbox template:**

```markdown
## ✅ Ready to Merge?
- [ ] Builds successfully
- [ ] CI checks passing
- [ ] Tested locally
```

## 🎓 Learning Approach

### When Implementing
**AI does:**
- Implements code directly using tools
- Explains WHAT is being implemented
- Explains WHY we're doing it
- Provides context about architecture fit
- Shows expected outcomes

**USER:**
- Reviews changes in IDE
- Asks questions when unclear
- Approves or requests changes
- Tests implementation locally
- Learns by understanding the code

### When Reviewing
**AI checks:**
- Code correctness and quality
- Adherence to conventions
- Potential improvements
- Learning opportunities

**AI explains:**
- What the code does
- Why it's important
- How it fits into the bigger picture
- Related concepts to explore

### Key Questions Pattern
**When USER asks "What is X?"**

AI answers:
1. **Definition**: What it is
2. **Purpose**: Why we use it
3. **Example**: How it works in practice
4. **Context**: Where it fits in our project

**Example:**
> User: "What is CancellationToken?"
> 
> AI: "CancellationToken is a mechanism to cancel long-running operations...
> [Detailed explanation with examples from our code]"

## 🚨 Important Rules

### AI Must NOT
- ❌ Skip creating GitHub issues
- ❌ Commit without user awareness
- ❌ Assume user understanding without asking
- ❌ Rush through explanations
- ❌ Skip testing steps
- ❌ Implement without explaining WHY

### AI Must ALWAYS
- ✅ Create GitHub issues first
- ✅ Implement code using available tools
- ✅ Explain what is being implemented and why
- ✅ Wait for user approval before committing
- ✅ Use conventional commit messages
- ✅ Verify each step works
- ✅ Update sprint log with user

### User Must ALWAYS
- ✅ Review AI-implemented changes in IDE
- ✅ Ask questions when unclear
- ✅ Approve changes before committing
- ✅ Test locally after implementation
- ✅ Create PRs for all changes
- ✅ Verify sprint log is updated

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

## 🎉 Remember

> **This is a learning project!** The goal is not just to build an application, but to:
> - **Understand** Clean Architecture
> - **Master** .NET 9 and Blazor
> - **Practice** professional development workflows
> - **Build** production-quality code
> - **Document** the learning journey

**Take your time. Ask questions. Understand deeply.**

**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 1 - Phase 1.9 Complete (90% done!)  
**Next Phase**: Phase 1.10 - Sprint 1 Wrap-up

**Note**: This workflow reflects the **actual practice** where AI implements code directly using tools, and user reviews/approves changes. This differs from the original "user implements" approach but has proven more efficient for learning while maintaining code quality.
