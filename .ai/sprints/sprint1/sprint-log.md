## WEEK 1: Core Setup & Data Layer

### Day 1 - October 17, 2025
**Phases completed**:
- [x] Phase 1.1: Core Domain Entities ✅
- [x] Phase 1.2: Infrastructure - Database Setup ✅

**What I learned**:

**Phase 1.1 - Core Domain Entities:**
- Created BaseEntity abstract class with common properties (Id, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, IsDeleted)
- Created enums for MetricType, PlatformType, and PullRequestStatus
- Created all domain entities: Developer, Repository, Commit, PullRequest, Metric
- Defined navigation properties for entity relationships
- Created IRepository<T> and IUnitOfWork interfaces
- Learned about CancellationToken for cancelling async operations
- Learned about Expression<Func<T, bool>> for flexible LINQ queries

**Phase 1.2 - Infrastructure & Database:**
- Created entity configurations using IEntityTypeConfiguration<T> for all 5 entities
- Used Fluent API to configure properties, constraints, and relationships
- Learned about `.HasMaxLength()`, `.IsRequired()`, `.HasConversion<string>()` for enums
- Configured indexes for better query performance (unique, composite, and regular indexes)
- Set up foreign key relationships with CASCADE delete behavior
- Configured many-to-many relationship between Developer and Repository
- Used `ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly()` to auto-load all configurations
- Created comprehensive migration with `dotnet ef migrations add InitialDatabaseSchema`
- Applied migration to PostgreSQL database with `dotnet ef database update`
- Verified all 6 tables created: Developers, Repositories, Commits, PullRequests, Metrics, DeveloperRepository
- All indexes and foreign keys properly created in PostgreSQL

**Time spent**: ~3 hours  
**Blockers**: None  
**Notes**: 
- Core layer is complete and builds successfully! All entities follow Clean Architecture principles.
- Database schema fully configured with proper relationships, indexes, and constraints
- Created feature branch for Phase 1.1: `feature/sprint1-phase1.1-core-entities` → Merged via PR #20
- Created feature branch for Phase 1.2: `sprint1/phase1.2-infrastructure-database-#21`
- Following professional git workflow: feature branch → commit → push → PR → merge
- Issue-driven development: Each phase has a GitHub issue
