## WEEK 1: Core Setup & Data Layer

### Day 1 - October 17, 2025
**Phases completed**:
- [x] Phase 1.1: Core Domain Entities ‚úÖ
- [x] Phase 1.2: Infrastructure - Database Setup ‚úÖ
- [x] Phase 1.3: Repository Pattern Implementation ‚úÖ

**What I learned**:

**Phase 1.1 - Core Domain Entities:**
- Created BaseEntity abstract class with common properties (Id, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, IsDeleted)
- Created enums for MetricType, PlatformType, and PullRequestStatus
- Created all domain entities: Developer, Repository, Commit, PullRequest, Metric
- Defined navigation properties for entity relationships
- Created IRepository<T> and IUnitOfWork interfaces
- Learned about CancellationToken for cancelling async operations
- Learned about Expression<Func<T, bool>> for flexible LINQ queries

**Phase 1.2 - Infrastructure & Database:**
- Created entity configurations using IEntityTypeConfiguration<T> for all 5 entities
- Used Fluent API to configure properties, constraints, and relationships
- Learned about `.HasMaxLength()`, `.IsRequired()`, `.HasConversion<string>()` for enums
- Configured indexes for better query performance (unique, composite, and regular indexes)
- Set up foreign key relationships with CASCADE delete behavior
- Configured many-to-many relationship between Developer and Repository
- Used `ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly()` to auto-load all configurations
- Created comprehensive migration with `dotnet ef migrations add InitialDatabaseSchema`
- Applied migration to PostgreSQL database with `dotnet ef database update`
- Verified all 6 tables created: Developers, Repositories, Commits, PullRequests, Metrics, DeveloperRepository
- All indexes and foreign keys properly created in PostgreSQL

**Phase 1.3 - Repository Pattern:**
- Implemented generic `Repository<T>` class implementing `IRepository<T>` interface
- Used `DbSet<T>` and `context.Set<T>()` for dynamic entity access
- Learned about `AsNoTracking()` for read-only queries (better performance)
- Implemented `FindAsync()` with `Expression<Func<T, bool>>` for flexible queries
- Implemented `UnitOfWork` class implementing `IUnitOfWork` interface
- Used Dictionary to cache repositories (lazy loading pattern)
- Implemented transaction management: BeginTransaction, Commit, Rollback
- Learned about Dispose pattern and `GC.SuppressFinalize(this)` to prevent double cleanup
- Registered services in DI container using `AddScoped` lifetime
- Used generic DI registration `AddScoped(typeof(IRepository<>), typeof(Repository<>))`
- Understood DI lifetimes: Singleton, Scoped (per-request), Transient

**Time spent**: ~4 hours  
**Blockers**: None  
**Notes**: 
- Core layer is complete and builds successfully! All entities follow Clean Architecture principles.
- Database schema fully configured with proper relationships, indexes, and constraints
- Repository pattern fully implemented with Unit of Work for transaction management
- All services registered in DI container and ready to use
- Created feature branch for Phase 1.1: `feature/sprint1-phase1.1-core-entities` ‚Üí Merged via PR #20
- Created feature branch for Phase 1.2: `sprint1/phase1.2-infrastructure-database-#21` ‚Üí Merged via PR #21
- Created feature branch for Phase 1.3: `sprint1/phase1.3-repository-pattern-#22`
- Following professional git workflow: feature branch ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push ‚Üí PR ‚Üí merge
- Issue-driven development: Each phase has a GitHub issue

### Day 2 - October 19, 2025
**Phases completed**:
- [x] Phase 1.4: Logging & Error Handling ‚úÖ

**What I learned**:

**Phase 1.4 - Logging & Error Handling:**
- Updated `dotnet ef` tools from version 8.0.10 to 9.x.x to match project EF Core version
- Added Serilog.AspNetCore package (v9.0.0) which includes Console and File sinks
- Configured Serilog with `LoggerConfiguration()` to write to console and rolling files
- Used `RollingInterval.Day` for daily log files in `logs/devmetrics-log{Date}.txt`
- Learned about `Log.Logger` static logger configuration before application startup
- Wrapped application startup in try-catch-finally for proper error logging
- Used `Log.Fatal()` for application startup failures
- Used `Log.CloseAndFlush()` in finally block to ensure all logs are written before exit
- Learned that `CloseAndFlush()` prevents log loss by flushing buffered logs from memory to disk
- Implemented `IExceptionHandler` interface for global exception handling (ASP.NET Core 8+)
- Created `GlobalExceptionHandler` class to catch all unhandled exceptions
- Logged exceptions with `_logger.LogError()` for structured logging with full stack traces
- Returned JSON error responses with different detail levels for Dev vs Production
- Used `HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError` (500) for unhandled errors
- Registered exception handler with `AddExceptionHandler<GlobalExceptionHandler>()`
- Added `AddProblemDetails()` for RFC 7807 problem details support
- Used `app.UseExceptionHandler()` middleware in pipeline (early placement is important)
- Learned about `IHostEnvironment.IsDevelopment()` for environment-specific error messages
- Tested the handler - it successfully caught database connection errors and returned clean JSON
- Logs are automatically created in `logs/` directory (should be git-ignored)

**Time spent**: ~1.5 hours  
**Blockers**: None  
**Notes**: 
- Logging and error handling fully configured and tested!
- Serilog creates structured logs with timestamps and log levels
- All unhandled exceptions are now logged and return clean JSON responses
- Created feature branch: `sprint1/phase1.4-logging-error-handling-#26`
- Ready to commit and push
